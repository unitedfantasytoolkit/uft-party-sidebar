## Party Sidebar Tab for United Fantasy Toolkit

This module adds a new tab to Foundry's right sidebar that displays party status. While it is currently fairly similar to the party window currently present in th Old School Essentials system for Foundry, there are a few key differences:

* The sidebar does not yet support distributing XP.
* The sidebar allows the GM to drag an item or a folder of items onto an actor to add the items to the actor's inventory without opening the actor's sheet.

**Note**: This module is currently in a *prerelease* state; as such, expect bugs, and please report those that you find!
